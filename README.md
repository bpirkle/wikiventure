Quickstart:
1) clone this repository to your GOPATH
2) execute "go get github.com/fatih/color" from the command line
3) execute "go run *.go"

You can, of course, execute the game in other ways, including building and running a binary. 

This game was inspired by a comment made by Cindy Cicalese https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:CCicalese_(WMF) during a meeting.

Implementation ideas were taken from Paul Fortin's blog at https://gocodecloud.com/blog/2016/03/19/writing-a-text-adventure-game-in-go---part-1/

Disclaimer: this is my first-ever Go project. I wrote it to practice with the language. The quality of the code (or lack thereof) probably reflects my level of familiarity with Go in ways that I'm not yet aware of.
