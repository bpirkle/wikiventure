Quickstart:
1) clone this repository to your GOPATH
2) execute "go get github.com/fatih/color" from the command line
3) execute "go run *.go"

You can, of course, execute the game in other ways, including building and running a binary. 

Color schemes are quite rudimentary. If the colored text output doesn't look good on your terminal, type "color none" (in the game) and colored output will be disabled.

This game was inspired by a comment made by Cindy Cicalese https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:CCicalese_(WMF) during a meeting.

Implementation ideas were taken from Paul Fortin's blog at https://gocodecloud.com/blog/2016/03/19/writing-a-text-adventure-game-in-go---part-1/

Disclaimer: this is my first-ever Go project. I wrote it to practice with the language. The quality of the code (or lack thereof) probably reflects my level of familiarity with Go in ways that I'm not yet aware of.
